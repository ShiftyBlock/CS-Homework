Part IV.

  Is mergesort stable?  Yes.
  Why or why not? Mergesort is by default, a stable sorting nlogn algorithm. My implementation reflects that.

  Is quicksort stable?  It is stable in my implementation.
  Why or why not? I scan the queue from left to right when partitioning, so we don't have extreme runtimes.
